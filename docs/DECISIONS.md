# Decisions

Running log of architecture decisions, deferred scope, and environment surprises.

## 2026-10-05

- **Foundry 1.8.4.** The local install was 1.7.1, below the v1.8+ requirement for
  Monad execution. Updated from the official `foundry_v1.8.4_win32_amd64.zip` release,
  checksum verified against the published `.sha256`.
- **Live chain check.** `web3_clientVersion` on `https://testnet-rpc.monad.xyz` returned
  `Monad/0.16.3`; `eth_chainId` returned `0x279f` (10143). Matches docs.monad.xyz/networks.json.
- **Scaffold.** Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, no Tailwind, `src/` dir).
  `create-next-app` rejects capital letters in package names, so it was run as `votalo`
  and copied into the repo root.
- **Spec copied unchanged** from the Monad hub to `docs/SPEC.md`.
- **.gitignore.** The generated `.env*` rule would ignore `.env.example`; narrowed to
  `.env` and `.env.*` with `!.env.example`.
- **License holder** is set to "Votalo contributors" as a placeholder. Confirm the legal name.
